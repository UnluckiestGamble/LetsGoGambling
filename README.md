⤷ ;; THINGS TO NOTE !!゛ ˎˊ˗

ᝰ.ᐟ ➜ I'm in college so I'm mostly ever online at night or free days ,, And if my age makes you uncomfy just don't ***int or block me***

ᝰ.ᐟ ➜ I don't mind dirty jokes and flirting ,, Just know where to draw the line, alright?

ᝰ.ᐟ ➜ GIVE US CUDDLES PLEASE !! LOVE CUDDLES SO MUCH ,, If you have C+H in your name be aware there's a *chance* (see what we did there?) I will probably approach you especially if it states encouraged ,, And if I'm alone and you want someone to come and cuddle with WHISPER ME IDM USUALLY !!

ᝰ.ᐟ ➜ Some fandoms I'm in and interact with in ponytown are Bungou stray dogs, Forsaken, May Madness 2012, Most MYCT but specifically Life Series and whatever new smp pow creations have made !!

ᝰ.ᐟ ➜ I'm a multishipper, rarepair shipper and SOMETIMES I do crosshipping so feel free to approach for ships, And if your interested.. My main ships from different fandoms are __Fyolai__, __Nikochuu__, Ranchuu/Chuuran and Fyoya (BSD) // __Ichance__, Doublefedora, Paycheck, Backshot/Secondchance, Noli77 (Forsaken) //  __Ellertrap__, __Winterseason/Lonelytrap__, Kirbycaleb and Polymadness (MM12) // For mcyt I don't do much shipping since I prefer the dynamics rather than shipping any of them together but I do enjoy Flowerhusbands, Jizzie and Aviscott.

ᝰ.ᐟ ➜ More info on Carrd and we have a pronouns page too ,, This gets update randomly and frequently for some reason... *Updated as of 12/21/25*
