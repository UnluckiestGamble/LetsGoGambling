ᯓ★ He/They/She prns! But He/Him is preferred!!

ᯓ★ I'm in collage, so have that as you will. And if my age makes you uncomfy just don't Int or block me.

.𖥔 ݁ ˖ I don't mind dirty jokes/flirting; just know where to draw the line, alright?

.𖥔 ݁ ˖ I LOVE CUDS!! Give me cuddles plea hehe. If you have C+H in your name, I'll probably approach you to do so, especially if it says encouraged, unless I'm with friends/moots. And if I'm alone and you want someone to come and cuddle with you, WHISPER TO ME!! ^^

.𖥔 ݁ ˖ Some fandoms I'm in and interact with in pt are Forsaken, Bungou stray dogs, Cookie run kingdom, Maymadness 2012, Life Series and Hermitcraft!!

.𖥔 ݁ ˖ Fav Ships: Ichance, Doublefedora, Paycheck, Backshot/Secondchance, Noli77 (4skn) Fyolai, Nikochuu, Ranchuu/Chuuran and Fyoya (Bsd) I ALSO LOVE ELLERTRAP!! (MM12) I'm a multishipper and rarepair shipper, But I don't mind alot of other ships so PLEASEEE INT even if the ship is not one of my favs!!
