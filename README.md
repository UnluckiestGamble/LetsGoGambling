.𖥔 ݁ ˖ I don't mind dirty jokes/flirting; just know where to draw the line, alright?

.𖥔 ݁ ˖ I LOVE CUDS!! Give me cuddles plea hehe. If you have C+H in your name, I'll probably approach you to do so, especially if it says encouraged, unless I'm with friends/moots. And if I'm alone and you want someone to come and cuddle with you, WHISPER ME!! ^^

.𖥔 ݁ ˖ Some fandoms I'm in and interact with in pt are Forsaken, Bungou stray dogs, Cookie run kingdom, Maymadness 2012, Life Series and Hermitcraft!!
